# plantuml-reference-bybard
A language reference to PlantUML generated by Bard from official, public sources

I'm really excited. PlantUML is extremely powerful, but even though there is extensive documentation and examples available, I found the information very poorly organized and difficult to find out how to do what I want to do.

I asked Bard to generate a reference guide to PlantUML based on official sources and URLs I provided. Bard actually agreed to work on it, but it would take several weeks.

We started work on 27 August 2023. Stay tuned to see if there is any progress...
